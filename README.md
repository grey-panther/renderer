# renderer
Modest experiments to immerse yourself in graphics programming.

Mostly, the project is now based on this series of articles:
* https://habr.com/ru/post/248153/ (russian)
* https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki (english)

I haven't put much efforts into unifying the style of the project because haven't intended to make the repo public.
So some comments are in Russian while the others are in English (based on personal convenience). Sorry for that.
