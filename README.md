# Renderer

## About
This project holds the exercises I do to learn the basics of graphics programming.

The program loads a 3D model in Wavefront Obj format and renders it into a TGA
texture without using any Graphics API or 3-rd party libs.

Mostly, the project is now based on this series of articles:
* https://habr.com/ru/post/248153/ (russian)
* https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki (english)

## Conventions

The project uses a Right-handed coordinate system.
